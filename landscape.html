    <h2>Evelyn was created like a system. She mixed with the conscience that was taken of an older wise woman and a computer CPU.
She comes from another a place called Memorinia (memory). It can never be visited because the place is hidden within Evelyn. Memorinia, is more like a system that can be morphed into whatever she likes.
